                    Mental health is a measurement of a person’s psychological,
                    social and emotional well-being. It affects the way people
                    think, feel and act. Poor mental health may lead to mental
                    illnesses such as anxiety and depression, but it may also
                    affect physical health. People of every age can improve or
                    maintain good mental health. Mental illness and poor mental
                    health are not the same, though sometimes they may
                    contribute to each other. But someone with poor mental
                    health might not have a mental illness, and people with
                    mental illness can still experience physical, social and
                    mental well-being, according to the Centers for Disease
                    Control and Prevention. Improving and maintaining good
                    mental health is important for everyone with or without
                    mental illness. In the same way that people make healthy
                    choices such as eating well or exercising to stay physically
                    healthy, they can also take steps to promote their mental
                    health. This allows people to be better equipped to deal
                    with stress, have good relationships, contribute to the
                    community, stay healthy and be productive. People diagnosed
                    with mental illness may have treatment plans that include
                    medication and psychotherapy, but they also benefit from
                    strategies to improve well-being and overall mental health. </em

                <h2 id="detaliitehnice-2">Why Is Mental Health Important?</h2>

                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em>Maintaining good mental health isn’t just important for your mood or emotional well-being, it also affects your physical health. Researchers have proven that taking care of the mind also helps the body and many other aspects of life.
                    In a study by researchers Hsing-Yi Chang and colleagues in Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics, researchers studied the mental health of people caring for chronically ill family members. They found that low emotional support and poor mental health increased symptoms of illness and chronic disease in caregivers.
                    People with the highest levels of self-rated mental distress are 32 percent more likely to die from cancer, and heart disease risk is higher in people with depression, according to Mental Health Foundation.
                    In the most extreme cases, serious mental illness can reduce a person’s life expectancy by 10 to 20 years, according to a review by Oxford University psychiatrists Edward Chesney, Guy M. Goodwin and Seena Fazel published in World Psychiatry.
                    “Many causes of mental health problems also have physical consequences, and mental illness worsens the prognosis of a range of physical illnesses, especially heart disease, diabetes and cancer,” Fazel told Oxford University in 2014. “The stigma surrounding mental health may mean people aren’t treated as well for physical health problems when they do see a doctor.”
                    Poor mental health is also associated with unemployment, low income, deprivation and increased health-risk behavior, according to an article by researcher Marc Ashley Harris in Health Psychology Open.

                <h2 id="detaliitehnice-2">How Stress Affects You</h2>

                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em>One of the main causes of poor mental health is stress, or what some people call “fight or flight” reactions.
                    Stress helps people survive in a dangerous situation or get them through a crisis. But now many people live in chronic fight or flight mode because of modern day stressors such as financial worries, friction in the workplace or difficult relationships.
                    According to the American Institute of Stress, the top three causes of stress in the United States are job pressure, money and health. In 2017, 63 percent of Americans were stressed about the future of the nation.
                    About 77 percent of Americans regularly experience physical symptoms of stress and 73 percent regularly experience psychological symptoms.
                    Getting stress levels under control is a good start to improving mental health. When people are under stress, the heart beats faster, digestion slows down, the body releases more sugar into the blood and muscles tense, according to Mental Health America.
                    Stress can manifest as physical problems including body aches, high blood pressure, overeating, insomnia, vulnerability to infection, chronic headaches and more. It can also lead to more serious mental health problems such as anxiety or depression.

                  <br /><em>Signs of increased stress are also signs of poor mental health. People who suffer from these symptoms can take steps to improve their health. Sometimes, this means seeking professional help.
                    This list is only for reference. Only a qualified health professional can diagnose or treat a mental health condition. If you feel you need immediate help, reach out to a health care provider right away.

                  <br /><em>You are you easily irritated.
                    You drink excessively or smoke to deal with stress even if you know it isn’t good for you.
                    You experience digestive problems, such as indigestion, ulcers or irritable bowel syndrome.
                    You feel fatigued at the end of the day.
                    You feel overwhelmed.
                    You find yourself “emotionally eating” — eating unhealthy foods or eating when you are not hungry in response to difficult feelings.
                    You forget to take care of yourself.
                    You have excessive abdominal fat or have trouble maintaining a healthy weight.

                </h2>

                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em>The great thing about mental health is that people can improve it.
                     Improving mental health can improve physical health. It may even prevent
                      problems from turning into serious mental illness. Here are a few tips to 
                      help improve mood and empower people to take charge of their mental health. </em><br />
                </p>

                <h2 id="detaliitehnice-2">Reach Out and Connect with People</h2>

                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em>Several studies have shown that positive social 
                    connections improve mental health. These connections can 
                    come from friends, family or support groups with like-minded
                     people. In a meta-analysis of studies on mental health by 
                     Tayebeh Fasihi Harandi and colleagues, researchers state that 
                     social support gives people a feeling of being cared for, 
                     loved and respected. This leads to less anxiety, depression 
                     and other issues.</em><br />
                </p>

                <h2 id="detaliitehnice-2">Keep a Positive Attitude</h2>

                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em> Negative thinking influences physical and mental
                     health. Focusing on the positive as much as possible improves 
                     physical and mental health. The brain can actually be re-wired
                      to think positive with more practice, according to Mental
                       Health America. Keeping track of what you are thankful for
                        at least once a week is a good start.</em><br />
                </p>


                <h2 id="detaliitehnice-2">Make an Effort to Stay Active</h2>

                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em> Exercise has been shown to improve mental health 
                    by reducing depression, negative mood and anxiety. It also
                     improves self-esteem and cognitive function. Being active 
                     for at least thirty minutes, three times a week is enough
                      to get these benefits, according to a letter submitted 
                      to The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical 
                      Psychiatry by Dr. Ashish Sharma and colleagues.</em><br />
                </p>

                <h2 id="detaliitehnice-2">Increase Joy and Humor</h2>

                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em> Joy can boost your mood, fight stress and even help
                     manage disease. Laughter is good medicine — studies show 
                     that it promotes relaxation, reduces anxiety and decreases
                      pain, according to Mental Health America. Go to a comedy 
                      club, put together a collection of photos that make you 
                      smile or keep a list of your favorite jokes.</em><br />
                </p>

                <h2 id="detaliitehnice-2">Support and Help Others</h2>

                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em> Helping others can boost positive feelings.
                     Researchers studying neurobiology found that giving
                      social support reduced stress-related activity 
                      in the brain, according to a study by Tristen K. 
                      Inagaki and colleagues in Psychosomatic Medicine.
                       This can be something as simple as helping out
                        an elderly neighbor, volunteering at an animal 
                        shelter or being a shoulder to cry on for a friend.</em><br />
