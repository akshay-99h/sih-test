                      ><b>Challenge negative thoughts</b><br>
                      While it may seem like there’s nothing you can do about the symptoms of social anxiety disorder or social phobia, 
                      in reality, there are many things that can help. The first step is challenging your mentality.
                      Social anxiety sufferers have negative thoughts and beliefs that contribute to their fears and anxiety. 
                      These can include thoughts such as:</em
                    ><br />
                    <br /><em
                      >“I know I’ll end up looking like a fool.”<br>
                      “My voice will start shaking and I’ll humiliate myself.”<br>
                      “People will think I’m stupid”<br>
                      “I won’t have anything to say. I’ll seem boring.”<br>
                      </em
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                    <br /><em
                      >Challenging these negative thoughts is an effective way to reduce the symptoms of social anxiety.
                      </em
                    >
                  </p>  
                  <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                    <br /><em
                      >Step 1: Identify the automatic negative thoughts that underlie your fear of social situations. 
                      For example, if you’re worried about an upcoming work presentation, the underlying negative thought 
                      might be: “I’m going to blow it. Everyone will think I’m completely incompetent.”</em
                    ><br />
                    <br /><em>
                      Step 2: Analyze and challenge these thoughts. It helps to ask yourself questions about the negative thoughts:
                       “Do I know for sure that I’m going to blow the presentation?” or “Even if I’m nervous, will people necessarily
                       think I’m incompetent?” Through this logical evaluation of your negative thoughts, you can gradually replace 
                       them with more realistic and positive ways of looking at social situations that trigger your anxiety.</em
                    ><br />
                    <br /><em>
                      It can be incredibly scary to think about why you feel and think the way you do, but understanding the reasons 
                      for your anxieties will help lessen their negative impact on your life.</em

                      Mind reading – Assuming you know what other people are thinking, and that they see you in the same negative 
                      way that you see yourself.<br>
                      Fortune telling – Predicting the future, usually while assuming the worst will happen. You just “know” that 
                      things will go horribly, so you’re already anxious before you’re even in the situation.<br>
                      Catastrophizing – Blowing things out of proportion. For example, if people notice that you’re nervous, 
                      it will be “awful”, “terrible”, or “disastrous.”<br>
                      Personalizing – Assuming that people are focusing on you in a negative way or that what’s going on with other
                      people has to do with you.<br>

                    <br /><em
                      > When we’re in a social situation that makes us nervous, many of us tend to get caught up in our anxious 
                        thoughts and feelings. You may be convinced that everyone is looking at you and judging you. Your focus 
                        is on your bodily sensations, hoping that by paying extra close attention you can better control them. 
                        But this excessive self-focus just makes you more aware of how nervous you’re feeling, triggering even 
                        more anxiety! It also prevents you from fully concentrating on the conversations around you or the 
                        performance you’re giving.<br><br>

                        Switching from an internal to an external focus can go a long way toward reducing social anxiety. 
                        This is easier said than done, but you can’t pay attention to two things at once. The more you concentrate 
                        on what’s happening around you, the less you’ll be affected by anxiety.

                      begin to breathe quickly. Overbreathing (hyperventilation) throws off the balance of oxygen and 
                      carbon dioxide in your body—leading to more physical symptoms of anxiety, such as dizziness, 
                      a feeling of suffocation, increased heart rate, and muscle tension.<br><br>

                      Learning to slow your breathing down can help bring your physical symptoms of anxiety back under 
                      control. Practicing the following breathing exercise will help you stay calm:

                       you fear rather than avoid them. Avoidance keeps social anxiety disorder going. While avoiding 
                       nerve-wracking situations may help you feel better in the short term, it prevents you from becoming 
                       more comfortable in social situations and learning how to cope in the long term. In fact, the more 
                       you avoid a feared social situation, the more frightening it becomes.<br><br>

                      Avoidance can also prevent you from doing things you’d like to do or reaching certain goals. 
                      For example, a fear of speaking up may prevent you from sharing your ideas at work, standing out in 
                      the classroom, or making new friends.<br><br>
                      
                      While it may seem impossible to overcome a feared social situation, you can do it by taking it one small 
                      step at a time. The key is to start with a situation that you can handle and gradually work your way up 
                      to more challenging situations, building your confidence and coping skills as you move up the “anxiety ladder.”<br><br>
                      
                      For example, if socializing with strangers makes you anxious, you might start by accompanying an outgoing 
                      friend to a party. Once you’re comfortable with that step, you might try introducing yourself to one new person,

                      Actively seeking out supportive social environments is another effective way of challenging your fears and
                       overcoming social anxiety. The following suggestions are good ways to start interacting with others in 
                       positive ways:<br><br>
                      <b>Take a social skills class or an assertiveness training class.</b>These classes are often offered at 
                      local adult education centers or community colleges.<br>

                      <b>Volunteer doing something you enjoy, </b> such as walking dogs in a shelter, or stuffing envelopes for
                       a campaign—anything that will give you an activity to focus on while you are also engaging with a small 
                       number of like-minded people.<br>
                      
                      <b>Work on your communication skills.</b>Good relationships depend on clear, emotionally-intelligent 
                      communication. If you find that you have trouble connecting to others, learning the basic skills of 
                      emotional intelligence can help.

                      >The mind and the body are intrinsically linked—and more and more evidence suggests that how you treat
                       your body can have a significant effect on your anxiety levels, your ability to manage anxiety symptoms,
                        and your overall self-confidence.<br><br>

                      While lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough to overcome social phobia or social anxiety disorder, they 
                      can support your overall treatment progress. The following lifestyle tips will help you reduce your 
                      overall anxiety levels and set the stage for successful treatment.<br><br>
                        
                      <b>Avoid or limit caffeine</b> – Coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks act as stimulants that increase anxiety
                      symptoms. Consider cutting out caffeine entirely, or keeping your intake low and limited to the morning.<br><br>
                        
                      <b>Get active</b> – Make physical activity a priority—30 minutes per day if possible. If you hate to exercise,
                      try pairing it with something you do enjoy, such as window shopping while walking laps around the mall 
                      or dancing to your favorite music.<br><br>
                        
                      <b>Add more omega-3 fats to your diet</b> – Omega-3 fatty acids support brain health and can improve your mood,
                       outlook, and ability to handle anxiety. The best sources are fatty fish (salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies,
                        sardines), seaweed, flaxseed, and walnuts.<br><br>
                        
                      <b>Drink only in moderation</b> – You may be tempted to drink before a social situation to calm your nerves, 
                      but alcohol increases your risk of having an anxiety attack.<br><br>
                        
                      <b>Quit smoking</b> – Nicotine is a powerful stimulant. Contrary to popular belief, smoking leads to higher, 
                      not lower, levels of anxiety. If you need help kicking the habit, see: How to Quit Smoking.<br><br>
                        
                      <b>Get enough quality sleep</b> – When you’re sleep deprived, you’re more vulnerable to anxiety. Being well 
                      rested will help you stay calm in social situations.<br><br>
