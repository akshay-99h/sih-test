                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em>
                    In 2009, when I was 18 years old, my father took his own life. He stepped in front of a high-speed train, two minutes from our house at 7:30 am.
                     He left a hand-written note to my mum, and I remember reading, “I'm sorry…but I'm mad”.<br><br>
                    I will never forget the moment the police knocked on our door, and I heard my mum screaming as they told her. Some of the darkest nightmares
                    of that day still haunt me, but in the past six years, I have come so far with my own well-being and mental state. <br><br>
                    I want to finally use this opportunity to share my story and hopefully reach out to others.

                <h2 id="detaliitehnice-2">Suicide is not selfish</h2>

                <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
                  <br /><em>
                    Only a handful of my friends know that I went through this. 
                    I spent most of my undergraduate studies trying so hard to mask
                     all my emotions. That sudden loss of my closest male figure
                      meant severe commitment issues with boyfriends was just one 
                      of the problems I encountered.<br><br>
                    Every other week, I either start humming loudly or stage a coughing fit to disguise 
                    people around me discussing the selfishness of suicide. One occasion was a journey
                    on the Jubilee Line – there was a delay due to somebody under a train. A group of 
                    youths opposite me were swearing in outrage. You know those weird sick nightmares
                    you can’t wake up from? It felt like that. Thankfully, I managed to restrain myself
                    from exploding and ran off the train in tears as soon as the doors opened. <br><br>
                    Another time, I was getting mentally focused for a rehearsal of a Mahler symphony
                    (I’m an orchestral musician). We were about to do the last movement, and I had
                    some sweat-breaking solos on the E-flat clarinet. Already a mixture of excitement
                    and nerves was consuming me, and we were all waiting for the conductor to arrive.
                    When he turned up, he announced he was late because “some selfish **** decided
                    to jump in front of a train”. I completely seized up, but I was discovering how
                    to control this 'red' emotion by this point. I quickly left the hall unnoticed
                    , chain-smoked a pack of cigarettes (I'm a non-smoker) and went back into the
                    rehearsal after the break. <br><br>
                    Then I was at the Benicassim Music Festival in Spain – I'm an avid festival-goer.
                     My friends and I pushed our way to the front of Tinie Tempah's set. Out of the
                      blue, he started his unreleased song, ' Suicide'. Fuelled with alcohol and being
                       in the festival environment resulted in one distressing emotional breakdown. But,
                        thank goodness, I have extremely supportive friends. That incident remains
                         the one, and only time my friends have witnessed me crying. I realise now
                          that you can't expect or want people to censor what they say, and you just 
                          have to learn how to handle these situations diplomatically. <br><br>
                    When my dad took his life, I felt so alone (and still do occasionally) and
                     didn’t have anyone to talk to – I’m an only child. If there were a young
                      voice openly sharing about how they handle suicide, it would have given
                       me so much strength. At the time, ‘Simba’ (from the Lion King) was my
                        biggest inspiration. It sounds lame, but I tried to connect my dad with
                         Mufasa's death. <br><br>
                    The other day I just scooped up Wally and Meeko, my two beloved cats, and
                     started wailing hysterically into their little faces. I'm not sure they
                      entirely appreciated it, but I've learnt that a huge howl whilst listening
                       to my dad's funeral music is a very healthy and acceptable outlet. <br><br>
                    Depression has run in my family. My uncle (dad's brother) died by suicide 10
                     years earlier. I myself have experienced severe anxiety and mood swings and
                      went through a period of time where I regularly contemplated taking my own
                       life. However, I also have a deep desire to ensure I look after myself to
                        remain happy and positive. <br><br>
                    When you lose a parent, there can be some awkward moments in day-to-day life.
                     It's always an interesting challenge when you get asked what your parents
                      do or where they're from. I spoke to a close friend who recently tragically
                       lost her father. We laughed hysterically over a bottle of wine about all
                        those moments - like when your friend tells you she's stressing out
                         because she hasn't bought her dad a Father's Day present! Feeling
                          resentment towards a person who momentarily forgets this won't
                           achieve anything. Smiling and remembering something you're grateful
                            for goes much further.

                    <br /><em>
                      
                Understanding the mental state behind suicide is almost impossible because it's different for everyone.
                 My own coping mechanisms have spanned from reading every best-selling self-help book on the shelves 
                 o a method of counselling called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). I also bought a beautiful personalised
                  'Links of London' charm bracelet with my dad's name engraved on one side and 'a beautiful end' on the flipside.
                   It brings me peace every time I wear it.<br><br>
                There are hundreds more outlets I've utilised (probably ones I don't even realise or care to admit), but ultimately,
                 the one thing which works wonders for me is simply exercising. <br><br>
                I've always had a competitive, fighting, sporty beast within me. I used to train with the British swimming team
                 and now work out regularly, and it frees my head like nothing else. This is the other reason I want to run the
                  London marathon...what a great event to work towards. There's no better motivation! <br><br>
                Sometimes sport doesn't quite cut it, and there's one last coping mechanism I want to share. I've had a slightly
                 tough phase this year, and a few things didn't go quite to plan but doing one thing made it so much easier:
                  remembering what I'm grateful for. There's a popular piece of advice floating around the internet and can be
                   found in a bunch of self-help books. It's to write down 3 things you're grateful for at the end of the day. <br><br>
                I don't do this religiously (though when I go through a low patch, I can easily fill an entire notebook from Paperchase),
                 but it helps to do it mentally. I went to two music colleges in London. Hell, I actually went to university - a privilege
                  not everyone can receive. I also have an incredible support system around me. Most of them don't even know this story.
                   Various tutors, teachers and professors throughout my education have no idea how great they've been to me. Then I have
                    my best friends, my relatives and my greatest support beyond all else, my mum. Thank you!

                        I hope raising this money for the Mental Health Foundation will give me a further
                         sense of closure whilst opening a new door of connections to other people with similar stories.<br><br>
                        Please share my story and donate to the Mental Health Foundation. It allowed me to pass hope on to others
                         still in the dark. We can so easily suffer in silence, and I want to step up and change this. Knowing your
                          own mental state is the first step to managing it. It can be a hugely positive, rewarding story if you want it to be.
